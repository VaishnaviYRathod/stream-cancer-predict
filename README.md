# Stream-Cancer-Predict

Stream-Cancer-Predict is a Streamlit web application designed for predicting breast mass malignancy based on cell nuclei measurements. Users can interactively adjust input values via sliders, visualize data with radar charts, and receive real-time predictions from a pre-trained machine learning model.

## Features

- **Interactive Sliders**: Adjust cell nuclei measurements.
- **Real-time Updates**: See predictions update dynamically.
- **Radar Chart Visualization**: Visual representation of input data.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Uses a trained model for accurate predictions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stream-cancer-predict.git
   cd stream-cancer-predict
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

4. **Open** `http://localhost:8501` **in your browser** to use the app.

## Usage

1. Adjust sliders to change cell nuclei measurements.
2. View real-time updates in the radar chart.
3. Receive predictions and probabilities instantly.
